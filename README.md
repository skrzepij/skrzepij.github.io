# Skrzepij Portfolio Page>

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/skrzepij/skrzepij.github.io.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/skrzepij/skrzepij.github.io)

This is the repo for my personal portfolio: https://skrzepij.github.io and http://skrzepij.pl

## Development 

Website is created with latest Gatsby build (2.17)

All source files should be placed on `develop` branch.

Every new feature should be created on new `feature` branch, 
which should be merged (via PR) to `develop` branch after finishing the work.


## Build & deploy

Linting, testing, building and deploying process is automated by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). 

It will be activated every time, when changes affect `develop` branch.

Because of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) hosting policy, production bundle is located on `master` branch
